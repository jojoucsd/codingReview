This is a series of coding challenges project. Where I am attemp to group the question I have worked or seen in a similar group.

The idea of grouping them is mainly for my own study. Also I found many of the quetions often similar but depends the requirement of the output. The logic of algorithm changed and it's not like math equation where I can just memorize and apply. 

By grouping similar questions I think is similar, which helps me better understand the question and allow me to compare the algorithm . And understand the different approach

My goal is adding 2 new sub folders per week until there are no more similar (I think) 
and adding 1 similar questions to the sub folder each day

And every weekend do a folder review to refresh my memories
